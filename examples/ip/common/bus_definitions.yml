# common/bus_definitions.yml
#
# A central library of Bus Abstraction Definitions.
# Your generator script loads this when it sees 'useBusLibrary'.
#
# Width Parameterization:
# - Widths specified here are defaults
# - Individual components can override using 'portWidthOverrides' in their busInterface definition
# - Parameterizable widths should reference parameter names where applicable
#
# Direction Handling:
# - Directions are specified from the MASTER perspective
# - Generator inverts directions automatically when interfaceMode is "slave"
# - This eliminates duplication between master/slave definitions
