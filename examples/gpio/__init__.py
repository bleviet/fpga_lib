GPIO IP Core Driver Example

This package demonstrates the unified driver architecture for a configurable GPIO IP core.
It implements the three-layer architecture described in the concept document:
- Layer 1: GPIO Core Driver (high-level API)
- Layer 2: Abstract Bus Interface
- Layer 3: Concrete Bus Backends (simulation and hardware)
